## <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenakistiscope">Phenaki</a> - Pytorch (wip)

Implementation of <a href="https://phenaki.video/">Phenaki Video</a>, which uses <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04200">Mask GIT</a> to produce text guided videos of up to 2 minutes in length, in Pytorch. It will also combine another technique involving a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04439">token critic</a> for potentially even better generations

## Install

```bash
$ pip install phenaki-pytorch
```

## Usage

C-ViViT

```python
import torch
from phenaki_pytorch import CViViT, CViViTTrainer

cvivit = CViViT(
    dim = 512,
    codebook_size = 5000,
    image_size = 256,
    patch_size = 32,
    temporal_patch_size = 2,
    spatial_depth = 4,
    temporal_depth = 4,
    dim_head = 64,
    heads = 8
).cuda()

trainer = CViViTTrainer(
    cvivit,
    folder = '/path/to/images/or/videos',
    batch_size = 4,
    grad_accum_every = 4,
    train_on_images = False,  # you can train on images first, before fine tuning on video, for sample efficiency
    use_ema = False,          # recommended to be turned on (keeps exponential moving averaged cvivit) unless if you don't have enough resources
    num_train_steps = 10000
)

trainer.train()               # reconstructions and checkpoints will be saved periodically to ./results

```

Phenaki

```python
import torch
from phenaki_pytorch import CViViT, MaskGit, Phenaki

cvivit = CViViT(
    dim = 512,
    codebook_size = 5000,
    image_size = (256, 128),  # video with rectangular screen allowed
    patch_size = 32,
    temporal_patch_size = 2,
    spatial_depth = 4,
    temporal_depth = 4,
    dim_head = 64,
    heads = 8
)

cvivit.load('/path/to/trained/cvivit.pt')

maskgit = MaskGit(
    num_tokens = 5000,
    max_seq_len = 1024,
    dim = 512,
    dim_context = 768,
    depth = 6,
)

phenaki = Phenaki(
    cvivit = cvivit,
    maskgit = maskgit
).cuda()

videos = torch.randn(3, 3, 17, 256, 128).cuda() # (batch, channels, frames, height, width)
mask = torch.ones((3, 17)).bool().cuda() # [optional] (batch, frames) - allows for co-training videos of different lengths as well as video and images in the same batch

texts = [
    'a whale breaching from afar',
    'young girl blowing out candles on her birthday cake',
    'fireworks with blue and green sparkles'
]

loss = phenaki(videos, texts = texts, video_frame_mask = mask)
loss.backward()

# do the above for many steps, then ...

video = phenaki.sample(texts = 'a squirrel examines an acorn', num_frames = 17, cond_scale = 5.) # (1, 3, 17, 256, 128)

# so in the paper, they do not really achieve 2 minutes of coherent video
# at each new scene with new text conditioning, they condition on the previous K frames
# you can easily achieve this with this framework as so

video_prime = video[:, :, -3:] # (1, 3, 3, 256, 128) # say K = 3

video_next = phenaki.sample(texts = 'a cat watches the squirrel from afar', prime_frames = video_prime, num_frames = 14) # (1, 3, 14, 256, 128)

# the total video

entire_video = torch.cat((video, video_next), dim = 2) # (1, 3, 17 + 14, 256, 128)

# and so on...
```

Or just import the `make_video` function

```python
# ... above code

from phenaki_pytorch import make_video

entire_video, scenes = make_video(phenaki, texts = [
    'a squirrel examines an acorn buried in the snow',
    'a cat watches the squirrel from a frosted window sill',
    'zoom out to show the entire living room, with the cat residing by the window sill'
], num_frames = (17, 14, 14), prime_lengths = (5, 5))

entire_video.shape # (1, 3, 17 + 14 + 14 = 45, 256, 256)

# scenes - List[Tensor[3]] - video segment of each scene
```

That's it!

## Phenaki Trainer (wip)

This repository will also endeavor to allow the researcher to train on text-to-image and then text-to-video. Similarly, for unconditional training, the researcher should be able to first train on images and then fine tune on video. Below is an example for text-to-video


```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset
from phenaki_pytorch import CViViT, MaskGit, Phenaki, PhenakiTrainer

cvivit = CViViT(
    dim = 512,
    codebook_size = 5000,
    image_size = 256,
    patch_size = 32,
    temporal_patch_size = 2,
    spatial_depth = 4,
    temporal_depth = 4,
    dim_head = 64,
    heads = 8
)

cvivit.load('/path/to/trained/cvivit.pt')

maskgit = MaskGit(
    num_tokens = 5000,
    max_seq_len = 1024,
    dim = 512,
    dim_context = 768,
    depth = 6,
    unconditional = False
)

phenaki = Phenaki(
    cvivit = cvivit,
    maskgit = maskgit
).cuda()

# mock text video dataset
# you will have to extend your own, and return the (<video tensor>, <caption>) tuple

class MockTextVideoDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(
        self,
        length = 100,
        image_size = 256,
        num_frames = 17
    ):
        super().__init__()
        self.num_frames = num_frames
        self.image_size = image_size
        self.len = length

    def __len__(self):
        return self.len

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        video = torch.randn(3, self.num_frames, self.image_size, self.image_size)
        caption = 'video caption'
        return video, caption

dataset = MockTextVideoDataset()

# pass in the dataset

trainer = PhenakiTrainer(
    phenaki = phenaki,
    batch_size = 4,
    grad_accum_every = 4,
    train_on_images = False, # if your mock dataset above return (images, caption) pairs, set this to True
    dataset = dataset,       # pass in your dataset here
    sample_texts_file_path = '/path/to/captions.txt' # each caption should be on a new line, during sampling, will be randomly drawn
)

trainer.train()
```

Unconditional is a lot less complicated - But I will keep whittling away at the complexity of text loading

ex. unconditional images and video training

```python
import torch
from phenaki_pytorch import CViViT, MaskGit, Phenaki, PhenakiTrainer

cvivit = CViViT(
    dim = 512,
    codebook_size = 5000,
    image_size = 256,
    patch_size = 32,
    temporal_patch_size = 2,
    spatial_depth = 4,
    temporal_depth = 4,
    dim_head = 64,
    heads = 8
)

cvivit.load('/path/to/trained/cvivit.pt')

maskgit = MaskGit(
    num_tokens = 5000,
    max_seq_len = 1024,
    dim = 512,
    dim_context = 768,
    depth = 6,
    unconditional = False
)

phenaki = Phenaki(
    cvivit = cvivit,
    maskgit = maskgit
).cuda()

# pass in the folder to images or video

trainer = PhenakiTrainer(
    phenaki = phenaki,
    batch_size = 4,
    grad_accum_every = 4,
    train_on_images = True,                # for sake of example, bottom is folder of images
    dataset = '/path/to/images/or/video'
)

trainer.train()
```

## Token Critic

A <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04439">new paper</a> suggests that instead of relying on the predicted probabilities of each token as a measure of confidence, one can train an extra critic to decide what to iteratively mask during sampling. You can optionally train this critic for potentially better generations as shown below

```python
import torch
from phenaki_pytorch import CViViT, MaskGit, TokenCritic, CriticTrainer

cvivit = CViViT(
    dim = 512,
    codebook_size = 5000,
    image_size = (256, 128),
    patch_size = 32,
    temporal_patch_size = 2,
    spatial_depth = 4,
    temporal_depth = 4,
    dim_head = 64,
    heads = 8
)

maskgit = MaskGit(
    num_tokens = 5000,
    max_seq_len = 1024,
    dim = 512,
    dim_context = 768,
    depth = 6,
)

critic = TokenCritic(
    num_tokens = 5000,
    max_seq_len = 1024,
    dim = 512,
    dim_context = 768,
    depth = 6
)

critic_trainer = CriticTrainer(
    maskgit = maskgit,
    critic = critic,
    cvivit = cvivit
).cuda()

texts = [
    'a whale breaching from afar',
    'young girl blowing out candles on her birthday cake',
    'fireworks with blue and green sparkles'
]

videos = torch.randn(3, 3, 3, 256, 128).cuda() # (batch, channels, frames, height, width)

loss = critic_trainer(videos = videos, texts = texts)
loss.backward()
```

Then just pass the critic to `Phenaki`

```python

phenaki = Phenaki(
    cvivit = cvivit,
    maskgit = maskgit,
    critic = critic
).cuda()

```

Now your generations should be greatly improved (but who knows, since this is only a month old research)
